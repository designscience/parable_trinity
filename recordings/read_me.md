This folder holds ControlLists committed when recording sequences for musical pieces. 

The files are named according to the media file name, with a .temp.seqx extension. 
Recording to the same music will reload the file so it can be added to.

To promote a file for use with a piece, remove the .temp portion of the file name so that 
it ends in .seqx and move the file to the appropriate sequences folder. 

Via con Dios!
